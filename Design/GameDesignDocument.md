# Resilience - Game Design Document

## Game Concept
"Resilience" is an open-world survival game where players must adapt to a harsh environment, gather resources, craft tools, build shelter, and develop skills to survive. The game emphasizes realistic survival mechanics and player autonomy in an immersive, dynamic world.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Explore** the environment to find resources and discover new areas
2. **Gather** resources such as wood, stone, plants, and water
3. **Craft** tools, weapons, and items to improve survival chances
4. **Build** shelters and structures for protection and storage
5. **Manage** survival needs (hunger, thirst, temperature, health)
6. **Develop** skills through practice and experience
7. **Overcome** environmental challenges and threats

## Game Mechanics

### Survival Systems
- **Health**: Affected by injuries, disease, hunger, thirst, and temperature
- **Hunger**: Decreases over time, requires food to replenish
- **Thirst**: Decreases faster than hunger, requires water to replenish
- **Temperature**: Affected by weather, time of day, clothing, and shelter
- **Stamina**: Used for running, jumping, and physical activities

### Resource Gathering
- **Foraging**: Collecting plants, berries, and other natural resources
- **Hunting**: Tracking and hunting animals for meat and materials
- **Mining**: Extracting stone, ore, and minerals from deposits
- **Woodcutting**: Harvesting wood from trees
- **Water Collection**: Gathering water from rivers, lakes, or rain

### Crafting System
- **Tool Crafting**: Creating tools for resource gathering and construction
- **Weapon Crafting**: Building weapons for hunting and defense
- **Clothing Crafting**: Making clothing for protection against elements
- **Food Preparation**: Cooking raw food to increase nutritional value
- **Medical Crafting**: Creating remedies and medical supplies

### Building System
- **Shelter Construction**: Building basic to advanced shelters
- **Furniture Crafting**: Creating functional furniture (beds, storage, etc.)
- **Fortifications**: Building defenses against threats
- **Farming**: Constructing gardens and farms for sustainable food
- **Water Management**: Creating water collection and storage systems

### Skill Progression
- **Survival Skills**: Improve efficiency in core survival activities
- **Crafting Skills**: Unlock new recipes and improve crafting quality
- **Combat Skills**: Enhance fighting abilities and weapon proficiency
- **Foraging Skills**: Better identification and harvesting of resources
- **Building Skills**: Unlock new building types and improve durability

### World Systems
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Affects visibility, temperature, and creature activity
- **Weather System**: Dynamic weather patterns affecting gameplay
- **Seasons**: Long-term weather patterns affecting resource availability
- **Ecosystem**: Animals with their own behaviors and interactions
- **Environmental Hazards**: Natural disasters and dangerous areas

## Game World

### Biomes
1. **Forest**: Abundant wood and wildlife, moderate temperatures
2. **Mountains**: Scarce resources but valuable minerals, cold temperatures
3. **Plains**: Open areas with good visibility, varied resources
4. **Wetlands**: Abundant water and unique plants, risk of disease
5. **Desert**: Scarce water and extreme temperatures, unique resources

### Points of Interest
- **Abandoned Structures**: Old buildings with potential loot
- **Caves**: Underground areas with minerals and shelter potential
- **Natural Landmarks**: Unique formations with special resources
- **Water Sources**: Rivers, lakes, and springs for water collection
- **Ancient Ruins**: Mysterious structures with valuable artifacts

## Technical Requirements
