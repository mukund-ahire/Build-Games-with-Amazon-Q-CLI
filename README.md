# Time Loop Puzzle Game

A puzzle game where each loop, your past actions repeat as "ghosts" helping (or hindering) your progress.

## Concept
In this game, you control a character trying to reach a goal. Each time you complete a loop or restart, your previous actions are recorded and played back as "ghost" characters in the next loop. You need to use these ghosts strategically to solve puzzles and reach the goal.

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to move your character (blue square)
- Press 'R' to restart the current loop
- Reach the green goal area to complete a loop
- Your past actions will appear as purple ghost characters in subsequent loops
- Use your ghosts to help you reach areas you couldn't access alone

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Run the game: `python time_loop_game.py`

## Game Mechanics
- Each loop records your movements
- Up to 3 ghosts (past loops) can exist at once
- Strategically plan your movements to help future loops

## Future Enhancements
- More complex puzzles requiring multiple ghosts
- Interactive elements that ghosts can trigger
- Time-based challenges
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
