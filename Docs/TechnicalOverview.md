# Resilience - Technical Overview

## Architecture Overview

"Resilience" is built using a component-based architecture in Unity, with systems designed to be modular and extensible. The game uses a combination of Unity's built-in systems and custom implementations to create a dynamic open-world survival experience.

## Core Systems

### Player System
The player system handles all player-related functionality, including:
- Movement and controls
- Camera management
- Survival stats (health, hunger, thirst, temperature)
- Inventory interaction
- Skill progression

Key classes:
- `PlayerController`: Manages player movement and basic interactions
- `PlayerStats`: Tracks and updates survival statistics
- `PlayerSkills`: Handles skill progression and abilities

### Inventory System
The inventory system manages the player's items and resources:
- Item storage and organization
- Weight and capacity limitations
- Item usage and consumption
- Item dropping and pickup

Key classes:
- `InventorySystem`: Core inventory management
- `InventoryItem`: Represents individual items
- `InventoryUI`: Handles inventory interface

### Crafting System
The crafting system allows players to create items from resources:
- Recipe management
- Resource requirements
- Crafting interface
- Item production

Key classes:
- `CraftingSystem`: Core crafting functionality
- `CraftingRecipe`: Defines recipes and requirements
- `CraftingUI`: Handles crafting interface

### Building System
The building system enables construction of structures:
- Placement mechanics
- Structure integrity
- Building requirements
- Structure functionality

Key classes:
- `BuildingSystem`: Core building functionality
- `BuildingPiece`: Individual building components
- `BuildingPreview`: Handles placement preview

### World System
The world system manages the game environment:
- Day/night cycle
- Weather patterns
- Seasons
- Environmental effects

Key classes:
- `WorldManager`: Controls world state and transitions
- `WeatherSystem`: Manages weather effects
- `TimeSystem`: Handles time progression
- `EnvironmentManager`: Controls environmental factors

### Resource System
The resource system handles resource generation and management:
- Resource spawning
- Resource depletion
- Resource regeneration
- Resource properties

Key classes:
- `ResourceManager`: Oversees resource distribution
- `ResourceNode`: Represents harvestable resources
- `ResourceSpawner`: Handles resource generation

### AI System
The AI system controls non-player entities:
- Animal behavior
- Pathfinding
- Decision making
- Interaction with environment

Key classes:
- `AIController`: Base AI functionality
- `AnimalAI`: Animal-specific behaviors
- `AIPerception`: Handles AI awareness of surroundings

## Technical Implementation Details

### Save System
The game uses a JSON-based save system:
- Serializes game state to JSON
- Saves to local files
- Handles loading and game restoration
- Implements auto-save functionality

### Performance Optimization
Several techniques are used to maintain performance:
- Object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Level of detail (LOD) for distant objects
- Occlusion culling for complex environments
- Asynchronous loading for world chunks

### Procedural Generation
The world uses procedural generation for:
- Terrain formation
- Resource distribution
- Vegetation placement
- Structure placement

### Networking (Future Implementation)
Plans for multiplayer functionality include:
- Client-server architecture
- State synchronization
- Authoritative server model
- Lag compensation techniques

## Development Tools and Workflow

### Version Control
- Git for source control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- Branch strategy: feature branches with main/develop workflow

### Project Management
- Agile development methodology
- Sprint planning with 2-week iterations
- Task tracking using project management tools

### Testing
- Unit testing for core systems
- Integration testing for system interactions
- Playtesting for gameplay feedback
- Automated testing where applicable

### Build Process
- Automated builds using Unity Cloud Build
- Version numbering: Major.Minor.Patch
- Platform-specific build configurations
